This is my configuration for NvChad. I started migration towards NvChad 2.5, but I gave up along the way.
I moved my configuration towards AstroNvim, and I have a mostly functional configuration for it here: https://github.com/corintho/astronvim_config
This repository will not receive updates, and I will keep it archived for now
